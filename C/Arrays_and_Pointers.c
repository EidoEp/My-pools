[Arrays and Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation for Arrays] */

/*
In a previous tutorial on Pointers, you learned that a pointer to a given data type can 
store the address of any variable of that particular data type. 
For example, in the following code, the pointer variable -pc- stores the address of the character variable -c-:
*/
char c = 'A';
char *pc = &c;
/*
Here, c is a scalar variable that can store only a single value. However, you are already familiar with arrays that 
can hold multiple values of the same data type in a contiguously allocated memory block. So, you might wonder, can we 
have pointers to arrays too? Indeed, we can.
*/
char vowels[] = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'};
char *pvowels = vowels;
int i;

// Print the addresses
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("&vowels[%d]: %p, pvowels + %d: %p, vowels + %d: %p\n", i, &vowels[i], i, pvowels + i, i, vowels + i);
}

// Print the values
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("vowels[%d]: %c, *(pvowels + %d): %c, *(vowels + %d): %c\n", i, vowels[i], i, *(pvowels + i), i, *(vowels + i));
}
/*
As you rightly guessed, -&vowels[i]- gives the memory location of the ith element of the array -vowels-. 
Moreover, since this is a character array, each element occupies one byte so that the consecutive memory 
addresses are separated by a single byte. We also created a pointer, -pvowels-, and assigned the address of 
the array -vowels- to it. -pvowels + i- is a valid operation; although in general, this may not always 
be meaningful (explored further in Pointer Arithmetics ). In particular, the output shown above indicates 
that -&vowels[i]- and -pvowels + -i are equivalent. Feel free to alter the data types of the 
array and pointer variables to test this out.

If you look carefully at the previous code, you will notice that we also used another apparently surprising notation: -vowels + i-.
Moreover, -pvowels + i- and -vowels + i- returns the same thing â€” address of the ith element of the array vowels. 
On the other hand, -*(pvowels + i)- and -*(vowels + i)- both return the ith element of the array vowels. Why is that so?

This is because the name of an array itself is a (constant) pointer to the first element of the array. 
In other words, the notations -vowels-, -&vowels[0]-, and -vowels + 0- all point to the same location.
*/




/* ### Dynamic Memory Allocation for Arrays ### 


By now we know that we can traverse an array using pointers. 
Moreover, we also know that we can dynamically allocate (contiguous) memory using blocks pointers. 
These two aspects can be combined to dynamically allocate memory for an array. This is illustrated in the following code.
*/

// Allocate memory to store five characters
int n = 5;
char *pvowels = (char *) malloc(n * sizeof(char));
int i;

pvowels[0] = 'A';
pvowels[1] = 'E';
*(pvowels + 2) = 'I';
pvowels[3] = 'O';
*(pvowels + 4) = 'U';

for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%c ", pvowels[i]);
}

printf("\n");

free(pvowels);
/*
In the above code, we allocated five contiguous bytes of memory to store five characters. 
Subsequently, we used array notations to traverse the blocks of memory as if -pvowels- is an array. 
However, remember that -pvowels- actually is a pointer. Pointers and arrays, in general, are not the same thing.

So when is this useful? Remember that while declaring an array, the number of elements that it would contain 
must be known beforehand. Therefore, in some scenarios it might happen that the space allocated for 
an array is either less than the desired space or more. However, by using dynamic memory allocation, one can
allocate just as much memory as required by a program. Moreover, unused memory can be freed as soon as it is no 
longer required by invoking the -free()- function. On the down side, with dynamic memory allocation, one must responsibly 
call -free()- wherever relevant. Otherwise, memory leaks would occur.
*/


/*
We conclude this tutorial by looking at dynamic memory allocation for a two-dimensional array. 
This can be generalized to n-dimensions in a similar way. Unlike one-dimensional arrays, where we used a pointer, in this
case we require a pointer to a pointer, as shown below.

int ncols = 5;

// Allocate memory for n-rows pointers
